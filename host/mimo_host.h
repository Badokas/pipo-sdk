 * @brief Modular Interface for Multi-modal Objects. Extends PiPo possibilities.
 *
 * Every mimo module inherits the basic stream description and data
 * passing methods (streamAttributes() and frames()) from PiPo, but
 * ignores real-time oriented methods (segment()), and adds iteration
 * for training.
